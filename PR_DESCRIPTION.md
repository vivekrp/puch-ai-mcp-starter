# 🚀 Add Comprehensive Setup System with Interactive Scripts

## Summary

This PR adds a complete setup automation system that dramatically improves the developer experience for all MCP server implementations in this repository. Instead of manual, error-prone setup processes, developers can now get any MCP server running with simple commands like `pnpm start` or `pnpm run bearer`.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before this PR:**
- Complex manual setup with multiple steps prone to errors
- Different setup processes for each implementation (Python vs OAuth)
- No guidance for system requirements or troubleshooting  
- High barrier to entry, especially for OAuth servers
- Poor discoverability of available implementations

**After this PR:**
- One-command setup: `pnpm start` launches interactive menu
- Automated dependency checking and environment setup
- Guided configuration for all implementations
- Built-in troubleshooting and validation
- Clear documentation with step-by-step instructions

## ✨ Key Features Added

### 🚀 Interactive Quick Start System
- **`pnpm start`** - Interactive menu to choose and set up any MCP implementation
- **`pnpm run check-deps`** - Validates system requirements (Python, Node.js, uv, ngrok, etc.)
- **`pnpm run setup-env`** - Interactive wizard for environment variables with validation

### 📋 One-Command Server Launchers
- **`pnpm run bearer`** - Python Bearer Token server (beginner-friendly)
- **`pnpm run bearer:task`** - Task management server (demonstrates user scoping)
- **`pnpm run google`** - Google OAuth server with prerequisite validation
- **`pnpm run github`** - GitHub OAuth server with configuration checks

### 📚 Comprehensive Documentation
- **SETUP.md** - Detailed setup guide with troubleshooting for all implementations
- **COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Complete overview with architecture details
- **WARP.md** - Updated development patterns and architecture guidance
- **README.md** - Updated with quick start instructions

### 🛠️ Smart Automation Features
- Automatic Python virtual environment setup
- OAuth configuration validation (KV namespaces, secrets, callback URLs)
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Color-coded terminal output with clear status indicators
- Built-in connection instructions for Puch AI
- MCP Inspector integration for testing

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Super Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Install and start interactive setup
pnpm install && pnpm start
```

### Specific Implementations
```bash
# Python Bearer Token (easiest)
pnpm run bearer

# Task Management (user scoping demo)  
pnpm run bearer:task

# Google OAuth (advanced)
pnpm run google

# GitHub OAuth (advanced)
pnpm run github
```

### Utility Commands
```bash
pnpm run check-deps     # Check system requirements
pnpm run setup-env      # Configure environment variables
pnpm run test-inspector # Launch MCP Inspector for testing
```

## 🔍 Technical Implementation Details

### Script Architecture
- **Node.js scripts** with chalk for colored output and inquirer for interactive prompts
- **Cross-platform compatibility** with Windows/Unix path handling
- **Error handling** with helpful troubleshooting messages
- **Process management** with proper cleanup and signal handling

### Validation Features  
- **System requirements** checking (Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, uv, ngrok)
- **Environment validation** with regex patterns for phone numbers and token lengths
- **OAuth configuration** verification (KV namespaces, secrets, callback URLs)
- **Wrangler authentication** status checking

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Progressive disclosure** - simple commands with detailed help when needed
- **Smart defaults** - remembers previous configuration values
- **Visual feedback** - loading spinners, success/error indicators, organized output
- **Connection guidance** - shows exact Puch AI connection commands
